    "\n",
    " - Evaluate the change in performance of the Random Forest Classifier, used in the class exercise, when using a selection of single channels from the mass spectra, combined with size and shape, versus all available channels.\n",
    " - Repeat this exercise but using the ExtraTreesClassifier in Scikit-learn. For this we would recommend looking at the Scikit-learn documentation. \n",
