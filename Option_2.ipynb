    "In practical 5, we started using Pandas dataframes to record informatiom on PM2.5 concentrations over China. Without using Geopandas, we were able to plot changes on a map and extract time series changes for a given region. In this exercise, we request that you:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Build a catalogue (visualisation) of PM2.5 concentrations over China as a function of time\n",
    " - Extract and compare time series statistics of PM2.5 concentrations in 3 provinces over the same time period.\n",
    " - Use additional data from a single site in Beijing to determine if the annual averages reflect the same trends as our Geospatial data. For this activity you can use data held at the following address: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/501/beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data\n",
