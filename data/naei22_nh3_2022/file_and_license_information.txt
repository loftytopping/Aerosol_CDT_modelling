This zip file contains ASCII Grid format and GeoTIFF files, which can be used in most GIS software. 
Pollutant-specific gridded emissions for the current NAEI year by CORINAIR SNAP sectors are included in each zip file. 
Note that some pollutants might not contain emission maps on some sectors (not all sectors generate emissions).

The sectors are labelled as follows:

01energyprod - SNAP 01 (Combustion in Energy Production and Transformation)
02nonindustcomb - SNAP 02 (Combustion in Commercial, Institutional, Residential and Agriculture)
03industcomb - SNAP 03 (Combustion in Industry)
04prodprocess - SNAP 04 (Production Processes)
05offshore - SNAP 05 (Extraction and Distribution of Fossil Fuels)
06solvents - SNAP 06 (Solvent Use)
07roadtrans - SNAP 07 (Road Transport)
08othertrans - SNAP 08 (Other Transport and Mobile machinery)
09waste - SNAP 09 (Waste Treatment and Disposal)
10agriculture - SNAP 10 (Agriculture, Forestry and Landuse Change)
11nature - SNAP 11 (Nature)
total - Total emissions (sum of all the grids above and point sources)

Point sources file information:

Year - The year of emissions
PollutantID - Numeric code for the pollutant species
Pollutant_Name - Name of the pollutant species
PlantID	Numeric - code for the emission site
Site - Name of the emission site
Easting - British National Grid Easting of emission site
Northing - British National Grid Northing of emission site
Operator - Name of the emission site operator
SectorID - Industrial sector of emission site. This is an NAEI classification that broadly reflects the sector primarily responsible for emissions at each site. The classification is partly based upon the 2007 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), obtainable at https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007.
Sector - Our assessment of the sector that the emission site belongs to (see separate tab for further notes on sectors)
Emission - Emission amount
Unit - Emission unit
Country - UK devolved region
DataType - O = derived from operator reported emission;  M = wholly or partly modelled emission, which may be subject to significant uncertainty.
	
General notes:	
- The operator name given is that which is recorded in our systems and may not be up to date/accurate for some sites, particularly in cases where data are modelled (so data type M).
- Emissions data for each plant may cover more than one type of source but have been aggregated to avoid disclosure of sensitive or confidential data.  The source type given in each row is that which is typically responsible for the highest proportion of emissions from that plant.
- For details of methods used to calculate these emissions see the NAEI spatial emissions methodology report at https://naei.beis.gov.uk/reports
