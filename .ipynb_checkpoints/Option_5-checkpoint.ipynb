    "In practical 9 we used the AutoML package to fit a model to predict PM2.5 as a function of meterological variables. In this exercise, you are asked to build on that work and conduct the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Evaluate the change in performance of the fitted model from XGBoost depending on the number of iterations allowed.\n",
    " - Repeat this exercise but using AutoML and changing the time budget allowed from 20 to 40.\n",
    " - Generate partial dependency plots for the best models to compare the influence of temperature and RH on PM2.5\n",
    " - Produce a SHAP summary and barplot for the best available model.\n",
