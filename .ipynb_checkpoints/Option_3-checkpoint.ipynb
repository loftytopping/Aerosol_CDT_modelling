    "In practical 7, we used GeoPandas to work with a number of geospatial data products. This included administrative boundaries and point source emissions. In this option we ask you to repeat this but focus on the diversity of point source emissions in 3 seperate authorities. This would include the following steps. \n",
    "\n",
    " - Build a catalogue (visualisation) of point source emissions in 3 combined authorities of your chosing\n",
    " - Produce a histogram of distinct sources for each region \n",
    " - You may use additional data that specifies the location of educational establishments for a single authority and display risk zones around the point source emissions. For this you can use the GeoJSON file 'educational-establishment' in the data folder\n",
