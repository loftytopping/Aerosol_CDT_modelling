    "## Assignment template 1) Evaluating the sentivity of droplet-growth rates to molecular properties\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical 3, we learned that condensational growth is driven by a difference in the partial pressure above the surface of a particle and that in the gas phase. As the concentrations within the gas phase change, along with any changes in the composition, morphology and phase state of the particle , the partitioning process redistributes species between the gaseous and condensed phases according to a combination of pure component and mixture properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "We translated the underlying theory of droplet growth into python code and then conducted some simulations for a size distribution. In this option, you are tasked with exploring some sensitivities of droplet growth rates to a number of model parameters. These could include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The ratio of pre-existing condensed to gas phase mass\n",
    " - The range of activity coefficients, and how they vary as a function of volatility\n",
    " - The accomodatio coefficient of the consensing organics.\n",
    " \n",
    "You may select two of the above and, with reference to appropriate academic studies, explore how the final condensed mass depends on the interplay between such variables.\n",

    " - What if someone wanted to get in touch with you and re-use this code? Any restrictions on data?\n",
